        "description": "🐏 As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries likes to be first in everything! A natural-born leader, the fearless Ram is able to get things going in an instant and is willing to try anything, although this sign sometimes takes on more than can be accomplished. Aries people are extremely dynamic and energetic, and they have to constantly keep busy. They are also a very charismatic sign, with the ability to easily attract others with their personal magnetism.<br><br>Aries people are often the most exciting among family members with their engaging charm and their daredevil personalities. They are frequently called up to resolve family problems because they have a knack for leadership and for getting everyone going in the same direction. As parents, they are protective but they can also be strict disciplinarians. Aries children are known to give their parents quite a few gray hairs! And with their siblings, they are competitive, but they love them deeply. In all of their relationships, Aries people are a force of dynamic energy.<br><br>Whether male or female, Aries does not take no for an answer when it comes to romance. When they meet an attractive potential partner, Aries doesn't play games. They are straight shooters and won't play hard to get. Aries people tend to be aggressive at times, though, sometimes scaring off possible love interests. By cultivating a softer approach, Aries' true strength and fine character traits will be more noticeable. Many Aries people, therefore, tend to rush into relationships and they may experience more than one marriage throughout their lives.<br><br>Nothing can stop an ambitious Aries who is intent on achieving a career goal. This is a very driven sign. Along with the drive, Aries people will work hard to get what they want. Aries is not all about hard work though. Aries is also a dreamer. They tend to dream big too - they often reach straight for the stars. Nonetheless, their drive and hard work allow them to often get exactly what they're aiming for. In business, Aries is savvy and shrewd and often winds up living the high life. Many corporate leaders are born under this self-motivated sign."

        "description": "🐂 Because they are practical and reliable, Taureans place a very high value on stability and security (both material and emotional). Taurus people are very faithful and patient, but when they become angry, they can easily transform into an infuriated bull! Because they have a tendency to be too conservative, Taureans would be wise to learn to accept new ideas and adjust to new situations. And although Bulls can be extremely stubborn, it's that incredible determination that helps them to achieve their goals. The Taurean's kind heart, stable temperament, and constant devotion will always make their relationships very fruitful.<br><br>Steady and sturdy, the Bull is often the one member of the family that everyone turns to when they need support or assistance. Taurus is kind and reliable, and always there when needed. As a parent, the Taurus is able to maintain a very even and low-key tone, which offers reassurance and stability to their children. The Taurean child relates to parental figures in much the same way — with consistent support and appreciation. A major difference comes in the sibling relationship, where there is often more of a competitive vibration — but when all is said and done, this is a loyal sign that cheers on and encourages siblings when they need a shoulder to cry on or inspiration to move forward.<br><br>The big strong bull can be shy and withdrawn when it comes to romance. Despite the appearance of bravado and self-confidence, Taurus people can be somewhat insecure when it comes to love. They are most drawn to outgoing people who make their feelings obvious. That way the Bull can feel self-assured of the other person's feelings. When Taurus marries, it is often for better or for worse. This is someone who will stick by a partner no matter what comes their way.<br><br>As in other areas of life, Taurus is very steady and reliable at work. This person is the one the boss can count on to get the job done. But because Taurus people lack confidence at times, they may not aim as high as possible, and often settle for less than what could be achieved. Taurus needs to constantly maintain the goal of high self-esteem to achieve a worthy role in the workplace."

Geminis are also usually very well informed; they always try to gather as much information as they can, which in turn helps them to more easily adapt to any situation. Quick-witted and smart, the Twins quickly become the center of attention in any gathering. At the same time, they tend to be not the most emotionally stable sign and can be very moody and change their opinions rapidly. If the Geminis can train themselves to always follow through and be more consistent, they can significantly improve their understanding and relationships with others.<br><br>Ruled by Mercury, Gemini is here, there, and everywhere — and that often drives other family members a bit crazy. This is a hard person to pin down, and this sign may not always show up at family gatherings as planned. But when Gemini shows up, this individual is often the life of the party and keeps everyone entertained. As a parent, Gemini needs to always make a point to be consistent, since it is this sign's nature to flit from one interest to the next and so may not be as unswerving as possible when it comes to parenting — but that can be corrected with self-discipline. As a child, Gemini doesn't always achieve the closeness with parents that they would prefer because even as children, people of this sign are off pursuing their own interests. As a sibling, there is quite often a lot of rivalry because Gemini is an achiever and often outshines and outwits brothers and sisters who aren't as fast-thinking or ambitious.<br><br>The Gemini person may love deeply, but this mercurial sign doesn't always show it. Sometimes this leads to miscommunication among lovers, and if not attended to, it can be a downfall of the relationship. But it doesn't have to be that way. Gemini people need to make a constant conscious effort to let their lovers know how they feel and to do the little things that mean so much and that show caring and nurturing.<br><br>The Gemini person is going in many directions at the same time because to this person, there are never enough hours in the day to get everything done. In business, Gemini often has many things going at once in the form of new businesses or investments. When employed by someone else, Gemini is always on the lookout for the next great opportunity. This single-minded determination often leads to great financial success."

Cancerians need to learn to balance their emotions because they often tend to be overly sensitive and moody because they feel everything very deeply.<br><br>Of all the signs, Cancer is probably one of the most devoted to family and family-like relationships. Cancer is sensitive and nostalgic and lives to enjoy family and friendship. Although there may be a lot of emotional drama when there is a Moonchild in the family, this person is usually someone that everyone turns to for a soft touch and kind encouragement. As a parent, Cancer is loving and devoted. And the parents of Moonchild children are loved to the moon and back by them. As a sibling, these kids are often the mediators, smoothing over conflicts and bringing everyone together.<br><br>The Moonchild loves deeply and forever. Sensitive and sweet, this is someone who usually remembers every birthday, every anniversary, and every special occasion of any kind. Cancer is loyal, loving, and sensitive to the needs of a significant other, but can be quite shy when it comes to public displays of affection. It may take a while for Cancer to decide to marry, but once it happens, it is usually for life.<br><br>Cancerians are often highly financially motivated and quite adept at maintaining a budget and getting ahead with savings. The Moonchild's career is very important because it is a way to achieve the security they yearn for — financially and personally. And this is also a dedicated employee who is trustworthy, hard-working, and eager to please. As a business owner, people born under this sign treat the business like part of the family, always nurturing it and staying on top of what it needs to remain successful."

The Lion's considerable talents help them to succeed in nearly any endeavor they set their minds to.

Because the Lion is the king of the jungle animals, Leos often think of themselves as the king or queen of the universe! But they need to learn to tame their pride and to be less concerned about appearances. Leos love to give without asking first. That's because they always assume their \"gift\" is truly needed. As a natural born leader, Leo can become a great inspiration for others.<br><br>Fiercely loyal and protective of loved ones, the Lion is proudly devoted to each and every member of the family. This sign is often the leader when it comes to family matters. Strong, loving, and regal, this person is always conscious of making everyone proud. When the Leo has children, those children are treated like little kings and queens — often pampered to the point of being almost spoiled. And the parents of a Leo are often treated in much the same way because Leos tend to always want to maintain and be worthy of the pride the parents have in their child's achievements. With brothers and sisters, Leo is charming and likable, but siblings may come to resent Leo's natural need to be in charge.<br><br>Leo is also the King or the Queen when it comes to romance, often lavishing a lover with gifts of flowers, candy, home-cooked meals, or whatever appeals most to the object of this person's affection. If a Leo is in love, there is no doubt about it because Leos more often than not wear their heart on their sleeve. And when you are loved by a Leo, you can rest assured that this regal beast will always be there to defend your honor and trumpet your achievements.<br><br>Anyone who competes with a Leo in the workplace had better get out of the way because Leos are very competitive and they play to win. Very driven and very smart, Leo is always on the lookout for opportunities to get ahead. Leo is the natural leader of the pack and doesn't know the meaning of the word \"no\" when it comes to earning a position that is coveted. Many Leos choose to be in business for themselves because being the \"king of the jungle\" by their nature — they don't like to answer to anyone."

Virgos may appear cold as there is a tendency to hide emotions and suppress natural kindness, although deep down they are warm and loving. Virgos always pick a logical and practical approach to all aspects of life which contributes to many of them being quite successful and independent. Although Virgos may appear cold they feel deeply and are in fact very reliable in all of their relationships. They will be glad to lend you a helpful hand if you get past the mask. This makes Virgo a very desirable friend and mate.<br><br>Modest and understated, Virgo people have to take care to show those they love how they feel. These people don't like to make a scene, and so they are often quiet and even withdrawn when it comes to showing emotions. Still, their steadfast loyalty and their consistent attention are appreciated by those who love them. Virgo parents are attentive but not overly demonstrative when it comes to showing the love they deeply feel. With their own parents, they were often so humble that they felt uncomfortable with too much attention or praise. Virgo siblings usually enjoy pleasant if not distant relationships.<br><br>Still waters run deep, and Virgo people are often very hard to read. That doesn't mean they don't have great wells of love to draw from - but their lovers are often left wondering how their paramour feels or what this person is thinking. Virgo is encouraged to express feelings more openly by being more demonstrative and affectionate. Learning to give and accept a higher level of nurturing will help the Virgo person enjoy more fulfilling relationships.<br><br>Many Virgo people achieve great success in business, but it rarely happens overnight. They aren't susceptive to taking big risks or leaping for chancy opportunities. Their success is usually attained slowly and steadily and over a longer period of time. But once they do reach the level they aim for, their success remains consistent. Virgo people are excellent at managing finances, so they know where every dollar they earn is going, giving them the power to expand and explore when in business for themselves. They need to keep in mind, though, that it's good to splurge once in a while and to make a point of seeking out the joy of life."

In their everlasting search for balance, they can appear to be indecisive. The truth is that Libras loathe the conflicts in life, and by pleasing everybody they try to achieve peace and harmony. Libras are the ultimate team players, always functioning better when they are paired up with the right partner.<br><br>Libra is often the peacemaker in any family situation. People of this sign are gifted at understanding very diverse viewpoints and seeing everyone's side of a story. They are excellent mediators, and they are exceptionally good at blending in with every member of the family and understanding what makes each of them special and unique. This makes Libra very popular at family gatherings! As a parent, Libra takes great care not to favor one child over another and is, therefore, a balanced and respected parent whose children are secure in knowing they are truly loved. With Libra's own parents, this sign shows equal devotion and — when there is a favorite — it is not made obvious for fear of hurting the feelings of the other. As a sibling, Libra is attentive and compassionate, which makes them a great best friend.<br><br>Libra people are in love with love — that's the best way to describe their intense fascination with romance. They fall in love easily and perhaps too often, and this sometimes leads to disappointment and disillusion. Libra needs to work at being more objective when it comes to love, viewing potential partners in a more practical way. For instance, if Libra is swept away by someone's outward appearance, they have to also stop and ask themselves if this person offers traits, interests, and characteristics that will blend well with their own.<br><br>Libra people are diplomatic, well-liked, and often quite popular among co-workers, bosses, or subordinates. Libras don't like work environments that involve complicated politics or chaos and conflicts. They are most at ease in a creative setting or one where their talent for diplomacy and mediation can be put to good use. Libra is a great team player and resents anyone who doesn't understand the importance of the team spirit. Libras who are introverts might do great work on their own and actually would prefer some degree of isolation while working but will still immensely benefit from the overall creative surrounding environment, which provides them with fresh ideas and challenges them."

Like their namesake the Scorpion, Scorpios have sharp powers of self-defense, and when they feel cornered, they will lash out. Sometimes they get carried away with their overwhelming feelings. Just like the mythological Phoenix, they burn themselves down and then revive from the ashes. Scorpio is known for having a very strong imagination and keen intuition. To avoid a tendency toward jealousy, people of this sign need to remind themselves how much they have to offer.<br><br>Scorpio people have a strong, consistent, and lasting commitment to family. And that includes long-time friends who become like members of the family. Even though Scorpio may not see family members on a frequent basis, they can always get back on track quickly and make it seem like no time has lapsed. Scorpio people are strong and independent, and as a parent, those traits set an excellent example for their children. When they are children themselves, though, those same traits may drive their own parents crazy. In sibling relationships, Scorpio people make great confidantes because they know how to keep a secret.<br><br>It may be hard to win the heart of a Scorpio, but once you do, you have someone you can count on for life. People of this sign feel deeply and love passionately, and once someone does them wrong, it can be hard or, more likely, impossible to get back into their good graces. Scorpio is also known as the sexiest sign of the zodiac. They are very affectionate and giving lovers who believe in keeping the fire in a relationship, so if you have a Scorpio lover, get ready for a life of passion and excitement.<br><br>When it comes to money and career, there is no deterring a Scorpio from meeting a goal. Scorpios are excellent at sticking to a budget, and they aren't afraid of working hard to achieve the financial status they seek. They have strong management skills, they rarely overspend or spend frivolously, and they have almost a sixth sense when it comes to seeking out good investments. Not surprisingly, having these traits, Scorpios are usually very good at managing projects both big and small."

Their mission to find perfection in everything could potentially cause this sign some disappointment, so they need to learn to be more carefree and not judge themselves so critically. Sagittarius's positive attitude and natural curiosity help to keep them going, and they rarely give up.<br><br>Sagittarians are always surrounded by family and friends - people of this sign love to laugh and enjoy deep conversations. Friends are almost always like family to the Archer. They maintain long relationships that often last forever and date back to childhood days. Sagittarians make excellent parents.

They need to learn that not everything is under their control and that it's fine from time to time to relax and to let go of their worries.<br><br>Capricorns are known for having very traditional values, and this comes through best in the way they deal with family. This sign is sincere and down-to-earth, and their relationships are equally low-key and comfortable. Capricorn parents are often somewhat old-fashioned, waiting up hours for their children to arrive home, and influencing and guiding their children long after they leave the nest. Parents treasure the Capricorn child because this is someone who is hard-working in school endeavors and is always reliable and trustworthy - even from a very young age. Sometimes with siblings, though, there is friction, as Capricorns can be jealous when attention is stolen from them. Still, Capricorn has a strong and abiding love for family.<br><br>Capricorns can be hard-headed when it comes to romance. People of this sign often do not know when to leave well-enough alone, and will go to great lengths to try to mold or influence their significant others to be what they believe they should be, rather than accepting them as they are. This, in turn, results in conflict, and Capricorn does not do great dealing with friction in relationships. Capricorn should steer clear of being too rigid or inflexible, and should be open to compromise for the greater good. This sign has a fabulous potential for fulfilling relationships, and can achieve them through self-knowledge.<br><br>Capricorns love to learn all aspects of whatever business they are in - whether they work for someone else or they are on their own. They frequently start at the bottom of the ladder and work their way up, so they can learn every nuance of their profession.

But their high-minded personal ideals and values make them overly demanding of others. If they become disappointed in someone, they can never truly forgive or forget. They are, by nature, very tolerant, so they can learn to be more forgiving if they so choose.<br><br>Aquarians tend to have high expectations of their friends - they seek out people who, like them, have deep integrity, are honest, and are intellectually inclined.

Aquarians have high standards for their romantic partners, and they set the bar impossibly high at times. Many see them as too picky and not open enough to the possibilities, but they are only that way because they place such high value on quality and integrity. But once an Aquarian's heart is open, it is a love that can last a lifetime. When Aquarius reaches a level of trust and acceptance, there is nothing this sign won't do for love.<br><br>Aquarians enjoy work that allows them to tap into and show off their intellectual prowess.

But when Pisces dwells in a living situation that is less than ideal, and not a source of strength, security, and comfort, it can significantly affect their mood and relationships. Pisces needs to create a home environment that is a safe haven to thrive and flourish — that's a priority for this sign. The happy Fish has excellent family relationships.

These characteristics go a long way to strengthen any romantic relationship. When a Pisces person is in love, it is all hearts and flowers. This person is great at self-expression and is very demonstrative and affectionate. In a good, strong relationship with a solid foundation, this is fabulous. But Pisces also lives to please and to be well-thought-of. That tendency can lead to being taken advantage of in matters of the heart when a partner does not appreciate all that this sign has to offer. Pisces needs to work at not being impulsive in relationships. They need to take the time to really know someone before jumping into a more serious relationship. A slowly built romance is one that could last a lifetime.<br><br>The Pisces person really needs to choose a career out of passion, or restlessness could easily set in. This creative sign has a deep need to be self-expressive through work and becomes bored quickly if that doesn't exist. Without that element, Pisces gets distracted and may wind up feeling lost. A keen imagination is the hallmark of this mystical sign, and the ability to dream and to create makes this person someone who would do well in a career that does not have traditional boundaries."
